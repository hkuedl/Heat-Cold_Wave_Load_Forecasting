# Heat-Cold_Wave_Load_Forecasting

*In this work, we introduce a data-centric framework, ESDF, to address the critical challenge of electricity load forecasting during extreme heatwaves and coldwaves. The core of our approach is a three-stage pipeline that sequentially addresses data synthesis, representation purification, and final prediction to overcome the fundamental limitations of data scarcity and the fidelity gap in synthetic data.*

This repository includes codes for article "Electricity Load Forecasting Under Extreme Heat and Clod Waves" and a brief introduction of how to use them.
